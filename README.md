# Trending Github Repos

## OverView
a small app that list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. in this app i used no third-party libraries for the sake of simplicity
also you will notice theres no storyboard cause legends dont use interface builder hahahaha, i prefer working with code cause i feel am in in control and leverage the UIKit
the app is well documented so no more talking here and explore the source code

- Xcode 9 / Swift 4+

## Installation
just clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/aminerop/trending-github-repos.git
```
